    "text": "1. layout_sf()\nAs mentioned before, a layout is basically the physical representation of where to place our nodes. When we are dealing with non-spatial network representations we must remember that the nodes are not meant to represent actual locations on Earth, but can be placed anywhere. ggraph provides several algorithms to make this happen. Let’s take one of the examples in the ggraph layout vignette to illustrate. This will include the layout + nodes + edges in a non-geographical representation.\n\nlibrary(ggraph)\nlibrary(tidygraph)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nggraph(\n  filter(net, group_components() == 1), \n  layout = 'focus', \n  focus = node_is_center()\n) + \n  ggforce::geom_circle(aes(x0 = 0, y0 = 0, r = r), data.frame(r = 1:5), colour = 'grey') + \n  geom_edge_link() + \n  geom_node_point() + \n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\nBut when talking about geospatial networks, we would usually want to place the nodes in their geographical location. A really nice thing about ggraph, is that you can give your own customized layout, by passing custom X and Y coordinates for node placement!\nIn sfnetworks, we have a spatial network consisting of nodes and edges. Since we have a nice integration with sf, we can extract the coordinates of our nodes as an X and Y coordinate dataframe, which we can pass to ggraph. Let me give you a quick demo instead of all these words.\n\nnet\n# A sfnetwork with 701 nodes and 851 edges\n#\n# CRS:  EPSG:4326 \n#\n# An undirected multigraph with 14 components with spatially explicit edges\n#\n# A tibble: 701 × 1\n             geometry\n          &lt;POINT [°]&gt;\n1 (7.533722 51.95556)\n2 (7.533461 51.95576)\n3 (7.532442 51.95422)\n4  (7.53209 51.95328)\n5 (7.532709 51.95209)\n6 (7.532869 51.95257)\n# ℹ 695 more rows\n#\n# A tibble: 851 × 5\n   from    to name                  type                                geometry\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;fct&gt;                       &lt;LINESTRING [°]&gt;\n1     1     2 Havixbecker Strasse   residential (7.533722 51.95556, 7.533461 51…\n2     3     4 Pienersallee          secondary   (7.532442 51.95422, 7.53236 51.…\n3     5     6 Schulte-Bernd-Strasse residential (7.532709 51.95209, 7.532823 51…\n# ℹ 848 more rows\n\nnet %&gt;% st_coordinates() %&gt;% head()\n\n            X        Y\n[1,] 7.533722 51.95556\n[2,] 7.533461 51.95576\n[3,] 7.532442 51.95422\n[4,] 7.532090 51.95328\n[5,] 7.532709 51.95209\n[6,] 7.532869 51.95257\n\n\nNow, how do we create a layout that extracts the coordinates automatically? Well here is a little helper function that will take care of that for you. It will extract the X and Y coordinates of any sfnetwork object into a data.frame that is understood by ggraph().\n\nlayout_sf = function(graph){\n  # Extract X and Y coordinates from the nodes\n  graph = activate(graph, \"nodes\")\n  x = sf::st_coordinates(graph)[,\"X\"]\n  y = sf::st_coordinates(graph)[,\"Y\"]\n  data.frame(x, y)\n}\n\nHow do we use it? Well, like this:\n\nlibrary(ggraph)\nggraph(net, layout = layout_sf)\n\n\n\n\nYes! That’s it. You are probably looking now at a beautiful blank canvas, but internally ggraph() has already a plan for every node you will map next, let’s see it in action in the next step."

    "section": "2. geom_node_*()",
    "text": "2. geom_node_*()\nThe most obvious way to represent a node in space is with a point. This is how we would do it if we were plotting POINT geometries in space. With ggraph we can get that representation with geom_node_point(). Note that other useful node representations in space might be using a label or text. We can achieve that with geom_node_label() and geom_node_text(), respectively.\nBuilding on our previous plot:\n\nggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +\n  geom_node_point()\n\n\n\n\nOh yes, there are our nodes! But wait… If you are familiar with the sfnetworks vignettes, you might be thinking: this looks distorted… and yes, it does.\nUnfortunately, ggraph() does not know about coordinate reference systems (CRS) so it will accommodate your X and Y axes to the size of your plot. This is one of the reasons why some internal tweaks are needed in ggraph to make this work better. But for now a way to go around this is to use coord_sf():\n\nggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +\n  geom_node_point() +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))\n\n\n\n\nMuch better. Now, our plot also takes into consideration the CRS and places our nodes properly.\nNow let’s give some aesthetics to our plot. If you scroll back up, you will see that our nodes don’t have attributes, other than their geometry, so what should we look at? What about the degree centrality of the node? This will calculate the number of incident edges for each of our nodes. We can do this with the centrality_degree() function in tidygraph.\nA really nice feature about ggraph is that we don’t need to go back to our original graph, mutate our network, save as a new object, and then call it again inside ggraph(). We can just call the function directly inside the aes(), where the calculation will be done on the fly! Read more about it here.\n\nlibrary(tidygraph)\nggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(color = centrality_degree())) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))\n\n\n\n\nDirectly passing functions also works inside facet_*() functions. sfnetworks has a couple of functions that can be evaluated in this way. To illustrate we can use node_X(), which gives us the X coordinate of the nodes.\n\nggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(color = centrality_degree())) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net)) +\n  facet_nodes(~node_X() &gt; 7.535)\n\n\n\n\nOK, probably not a real-world case scenario, but it gives an overview of what can be done!\nLet’s move on to the final step, and connect these nodes to each other."

    "title": "Geospatial Network Visualization",
    "section": "3. geom_edge_*()",
    "text": "3. geom_edge_*()\nNow comes the tricky part. When we are working with graph structures in, let’s call it, “abstract” space, the connections between the nodes are basically straight lines between each from and to pair. Although ggraph has quite a long list to represent edges (see here), the connections that I find most relevant for spatial networks are geom_edge_link() and geom_edge_arc(), which create a straight line or an arc between connected nodes.\n\nggraph(net, layout_sf) +\n  geom_edge_arc() +\n  geom_node_point() +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))\n\n\n\n\nYes, I bet you are thinking this could go to accidental aRt. But depending on the visualization you are creating, this geom can come in handy for some data cases, you can see it in action at the end of this post!\nBut now let’s look at straight lines or links between our nodes. We can of course pass aesthetics to all the geom_edge_*() functions, which refer to edge attributes. Let’s color our edges by the type of road:\n\nggraph(net, layout_sf) +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(color = type)) +\n  geom_node_point(size = 0.75) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))\n\n\n\n\nI know that for now you must be wondering: if we have a spatial set of edges with an explicit geometry, why are we just drawing plain lines? Well, remember I said this would be tricky? This is exactly what is missing from ggraph and the core of what I eventually want to implement.\nBut, do not despair! I am here to show you some workarounds, not fully ideal but something to work with in the meantime. Let’s remember that ggraph subclasses a ggplot object, so we can combine ggplot2 functions, and any other package that extends the grammar of graphics.\nWe will resort to geom_sf() for now. We can plot the edges of our network, by extracting them as an sf object with the function st_as_sf(). We have implemented a shortcut that allows you to choose which element of the network (nodes or edges), you want to activate and extract.\n\nggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +\n  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(net, \"edges\")) +\n  geom_node_point() +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))\n\n\n\n\nAnd there we go, a nice representation of a geospatial network! We can of course pass some aesthetics as well, for example an spatial edge predicate implemented in sfnetworks: edge_circuity(). You will see now that we can pass these predicates directly to the aesthetics inside geom_sf() and since our main object is a ggraph this expression will be evaluated in the network, pretty exciting!!\n\nggraph(net, layout = layout_sf) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = st_as_sf(net, \"edges\"), size = 0.8,\n    aes(color = as.numeric(edge_circuity()))\n  ) +\n  scale_color_viridis(\"Circuity\") +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(net))\n\n\n\n\nAnd there you have it, a swift overview of how to use ggraph and sfnetworks together."

To be honest I felt quite overwhelmed initially when the invitation was extended. Being a panelist with all those big names in R-Spatial was an honor and also scary! Nevertheless, I said yes and do not regret it one single bit!\n\n\nMy presentation\nEach of the panelist had around 10 minutes for a short presentation. I decided to talk about “Reproducible spatial data visualization with R”, where I showed how with 3 simple steps and a great pool of packages to choose from you can create nice spatial dataviz in R. See a glimpse below:\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\nFull link to slides here.\n\n\nThe panel discussion\nDuring the panel, we discussed the role of R-Spatial as a new member of the OSGEO community.

Simple features came here to stay and I am very glad it exists. Working with spatial data in R has never been easier, and that is because of this awesome package. I used it to read spatial data into R, to work with projections and to perform spatial analyses like joins, generating random spatial points, etc.\n\n\ndplyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse has made working with data in R extremely intuitive. Being able to work with structured data frames brings data science to a new level. dplyr is the first tidyverse package I learnt and I use it constantly for tasks as filtering, selecting, mutating, etc.\n\n\nggplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother package of the tidyverse is ggplot2, which introduces the grammar of graphics into R and is extremely powerful to create awesome visualizations. Two main functions allow you to combine this package with spatial data: geom_sf() and geom_stars(). One interesting tip, if you learn to use coord_sf(), you can do things like assigning a CRS to your plot, although your data has a different projection, as coord_sf(crs =\"+proj=geos\")\nThis are the ggplot extensions I use the most:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    ggfx\n\nTo give shading and glow effects to spatial features\n\n    ggtext\n\nTo add special formatting to text\n\n    gganimate\n\nTo animate the plots\n\n    ggspatial\n\nTo add north arrows and spatial scales\n\n    ggnewscale\n\nTo map multiple variables to the fill/color aesthetics\n\n    ggimage\n\nTo add images in spatial locations or as annotations\n\n    ggrepel\n\nTo automatically place overlapping labels\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nosmdata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis package is simply the easiest way I have come across in R to query OpenStreetMap data. I use it very often when I need to get data for small areas. For larger areas, for example a whole country, I use osmextract.\n\n\ntmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to plot spatial features fast and easy, static and interactive? Use tmap! I use this package a lot for my scientific publications because it allows you to use raster RGB images and vector data really easy. To get a bit more creative it has some limitations, and that is why I did not use it as often as ggplot2 on this challenge. But, one of the main features I like about this one is the ability to call tm_facets() and get individual plots of features grouped by a category, and let scales x and y be free. This is not possible with ggplot2. See that in action on Day 22: Boundaries.\nNote: This hex logo is not official yet but I love it! Waiting eagerly for version 4 of tmap to launch this nice logo and many new features!\n\n\nscico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabio Crameri provided the whole scientific community a great set of scientific color palettes to fairly represent data that is universaly readable! scico allows you to use the palettes in R. Another great source of palettes is viridis, which is already easily accessible in ggplot2 with scale_*_viridis_*().\n\n\nstars\n\n\nstars really needs a hex logo 🙏\nSpatiotemporal Arrays, Raster and Vector Data Cubes are handled neatly with stars. For anything raster or netcdf related this is my go-to package. It might be a bit complex to start with this package, but it is definitely worth it.\nOther options to work with raster data are raster and terra form the rspatial universe, which I actually use when I need to create hillshades from elevation data."

For example, find the one for the better landscape template here.\nGoing through the template will reveal to you if what you want to change is a YAML parameter, most likely when the line starts with $if(parameter_name).\nIf it is not a YAML parameter, you can add an HTML chunk to your RMarkdown file that will hopefully override the settings you want (it does not always work or I lack the HTML/CSS knowledge to figure out why!)\nThis are the HTML changes I made to my poster:\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n.outer h1 {\n text-align: center;\n margin-top: 0.6in;\n margin-bottom: -0.4in;\n}\ncaption {\n margin-top: 0px;\n margin-bottom: 2px;\n padding-top: 0in;\n padding-bottom: 0in;\n font-size: 23pt;\n}\n.caption {\n margin-top: -2px;\n margin-bottom: 2px;\n padding-top: 0in;\n padding-bottom: 0in;\n font-size: 23pt;\n}\n.main p {\n padding-top: 0%;\n text-align: center;\n}\n.main_pic {\n margin-top: -1in;\n display: inline-block;\n text-align: center;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;"

    "text": "Tip #3\n\nUsing tmap to show results? Take some shortcuts when designing\n\ntmap by Martijn Tennekes (@MartijnTennekes) is an excellent package to generate beautiful maps, especially if you want to combine raster and vector data.\nBut, designing your figure might be hard when you want to add legends, or distinct elements and you suddenly have white space all around.\nThis can become specially frustrating when the space in your poster is not infinite. Version 4 for tmap is soon coming, but in the meantime I still use the CRAN version to build my plots. I find tmap::tm_add_legend() and tmap::tmap_arrange() excellent functions to work around design issues, and one shortcut I usually take is to build my legend separate from the map, so that I can work with the space in an easier way.\nBut, problem incoming! When I tried to print two different figures in RMarkdown, i.e. the actual plot and the legend in a single code chunk, the figure width and height was used for both figures, without options to provide different heights.\nResult? I had a very big white space below my legend.\nSolution? Use two code chunks! This will allow you to give different dimensions to each output. If you need to add a figure caption, do it on the second plot, and to avoid an empty line between two figures, place your code chunks completely together, with no line break:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: figure\n#| fig-width: 10\n#| fig-height: 10\n#| crop: true\nlibrary(tmap)\ntm1 = tm_shape(data) +\n  tm_polygons() \ntm2 = tm_shape(data) +\n  tm_polygons() \ntmap_arrange(tm1, tm2)\n#| label: legend\n#| fig-width: 10\n#| fig-height: 1\n#| fig-cap: \"Your figure caption.\"\n#| crop: true\ntm_shape(data) +\n  tm_polygons(legend.show = FALSE) +\n  tm_add_legend()\n```"
