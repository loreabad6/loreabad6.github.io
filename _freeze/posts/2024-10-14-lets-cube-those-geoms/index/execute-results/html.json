Thank you for stopping by! 💐\n\nI was invited by Dr. Fernando Benitez (thank you so much for considering me!) to give a talk on a topic I am working on, so I decided to [talk about vector data cubes](https://begin.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2024/09/26/begin-seminar-dr-lorena-cristina-abad-crespo/) 😊.\nThis post compliments the talk by writing out what I discussed during the seminar and by providing the code to reproduce some of the work I showed. \n\nHere are the slides of my talk today:\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://loreabad6.github.io/slides/begin-vdcs.html\" frameborder=\"0\">\n<p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\n</iframe>\n\nAnd over here I will load some of the libraries I use for the next sections.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(cubble)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(here)\nif(!require(post)) remotes::install_github(\"loreabad6/post\")\nlibrary(post)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(units)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Data cubes\n\nData cubes are ideal data structures for multidimensional data. Think of data with spatiotemporal properties such as satellite image time series (SITS). If you work with SITS you might already be familiar with data cubes, as Earth system data cubes have received quite some attention lately [@Mahecha2020].\n\n::: column-margin\n![Earth system data cube \\| Source: @Mahecha2020](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/11/201/2020/esd-11-201-2020-f03-web.png)\n:::\n\nTools and initiatives like [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), [OpenEO](https://openeo.org/) and [Digital Earth Africa](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/) are using data cubes as their core for SITS analysis.\n\nOrganizing SITS in data cubes is intuitive and logical given that satellite images have consistent X/Y coordinates per pixel, and any reacquisition over time keeps the same X/Y coordinates. Here we already identify three dimensions: `X`, `Y` and `time`. Satellite images also have bands and we can then consider those as a fourth dimension.\n\n![4D data cube \\| Source: @Pebesma_2023](figs/fig-cube4d-1.png)\n\n::: column-margin\nI wrote a post almost a year ago on how to create [on-demand data cubes with STAC with R and Python](https://loreabad6.github.io/posts/2023-10-17-stac-across-languages/).\n:::\n\n# Vector data cubes\n\nTo quote @Pebesma_2023 at the very start of the Data Cubes Chapter:\n\n> “Data cubes arise naturally when we observe properties of a set of geometries repeatedly over time”.\n\nClearly satellite images for this description, being X and Y said “geometry”. But how other type of data like meteorological station data? They are also located in a X and Y location on Earth, represented by a `POINT` geometry. Stations collect data at constant time intervals, giving them a temporal dimension. Further, they can collect data on different type of phenomena, such as temperature, humidity, etc. So in essence, station data is multidimensional data that can be represented as a data cube. In this case, a *vector data cube* (VDCs).\n\n![Vector data cube \\| Source: @Pebesma_2023](figs/fig-aqdc-1.png)\n\n::: column-margin\nIf you are familiar with databases, you will find that the concept of a vector data cube aligns greatly with an [OLAP cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP_cube) model.\n:::\n\nAnother “naturally occurring” VDC case is when data from a raster or Earth system data cube is aggregated onto vector geometries. This vector geometries can be for example, political boundaries. The [`{stars}`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/index.html) package has a great example of aggregation of precipitation data over the North Carolina counties [right here](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/index.html#raster-and-vector-time-series-analysis-example). This is a sneak peek:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Load precipitation data\nprecipitation = system.file(\"nc/test_stageiv_xyt.nc\", package = \"stars\") |>\n    read_stars()\n# Load North Carolina data\nnc = system.file(\"gpkg/nc.gpkg\", package = \"sf\") |> \n  read_sf() |> \n  # Transform CRS to match precipitation data cube\n  st_transform(st_crs(precipitation))\n# Aggregate precipitation data over NC counties\nprecipitation_nc = aggregate(precipitation, by = nc, FUN = max)\n# Plot raster data cube\nggplot() +\n  geom_stars(data = precipitation[,,,1:9]) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\"Precipitation [kg/m^2]\") +\n  geom_sf(data = nc, fill = NA, color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(\"time\", ncol = 3) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Precipitation raster data cube](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Plot vector data cube\nggplot() +\n  geom_stars(\n    data = precipitation_nc[,,1:9]\n  ) +\n  geom_sf(data = nc, fill = NA, color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    \"Precipitation [kg/m^2]\",\n    na.value = \"grey85\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~time, nrow = 3) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Precipitation vector data cube aggregated by NC county](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Exploring VDCs with R\n\nIf you do a search for “vector data cubes R”, it is very likely that your first result is the `{stars}` package. As its name says, `{stars}` supports “spatiotemporal **arrays**, rasters, and vector data cubes”.\n\n::: column-margin\n`{stars}` pioneered vector data cube implementations in current spatial data science languages. Further efforts in Python with the package [`{xvec}`](https://xvec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are inspired by initial development in `{stars}`.\n:::\n\n`{stars}` takes advantage of base R’s support for matrices and arrays to implement common data cube operations such as slicing (filtering), reducing (aggregating), and applying functions to dimensions.\n\nTypically, data cubes are represented as multidimensional arrays given their capacity to support exactly that, multiple dimensions.\nHowever, when only looking at spatio-temporal data, I also use the [`{cubble}`](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/) package that implements \"a vector spatiotemporal data structure for data analysis\" [@Zhang_2022].\n\n`{stars}` and `{cubble}` interact very well when the data cube consists of space and time dimensions. \n\nTo showcase this interaction I will make use of some data from the [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) project and build what I call array and tabular data cubes.\n\n::: column-margin\n[openSenseMap.org](https://opensensemap.org/) has the vision to become *\"the Wikipedia for environmental data in order to awaken and promote education, environmental and climate protection, enthusiasm for STEM, citizen science, open data and open source.\"*\n\nYou can [donate to their cause here](https://opensensemap.org/donate).\n:::\n\n## Fetching the data\n\nThe openSenseMap project provides an API to query the information from the sensors shared on their website. \n\nI queried the API to obtain some data from sensors close to the city where I am based, Salzburg.\nYou can unfold the code below to see how I queried the API and pre-processed the data so that you know how to do this for other areas.\nHowever, I saved the result of the querying and pre-processing to avoid exhausting the API.\nThe data is copyrighted as © senseBox 2014 - 2020.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

way each row contains the station name (`boxName`), the timestamp (`time_start`) and the parameter measured (`phenomenon`). \nEach station also has a `POINT` geometry and each measurement has its corresponding unit. \n\nThe measured values (`arithmeticMean_1h`) are the only changing variables. \nThis value, as can be seen on the query code, is the arithmetic mean per hour of the observations for temperature, PM2.5 and PM10 for the sensors in the bounding box given.\nNot every sensor measures all the values and therefore there are `NA`s within the data. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

many NAs is that to create an array, we need that every dimension has an equal number of entries.\n\n## Creating a VDC with `{stars}`\n\nAlthough creating a raster data cube from SITS data is pretty straightforward in `{stars}`, creating a VDC requires a bit more pre-processing.\n\nHowever, when creating a VDC from scratch we get to understand better how [`stars` objects are structured](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/articles/stars4.html).\n\n> \"`{stars}` provides infrastructure for *data cubes*, array data with labeled dimensions\".\n\nSo, we start with the *dimensions*.\n\n> \"A `dimensions` object is a named list of dimension elements, each describing the semantics a dimension of the data arrays (space, time, type etc).\"\n\nFirst, we identify the dimensions in the `opensense` object.\nWe have a geometry (`geom`) that identifies and locates each station in space and we have a timestamp (`time_start`) that marks the temporal dimension.\nThe `point` parameter indicates if the dimension has point support (`point = TRUE` in the case of our `geom`) or if it is a period (`point = FALSE` in the case of our `time_start`).\n\n\n\n:::

there are 7 stations and 50 timestamps. \nThe `geom` dimension, that contains the geometries of the 7 stations have a CRS (WGS84), have point support and we can see a glimpse of the `POINT` geometries under the values column.\n\nThe `time` dimension on the other hand starts with index 1 and finishes at index 50.\nThe offset indicated the first time index, while the delta contains the information on the frequency of the temporal data, in this case, 1 hour.\nWe set this as a period, since it is an aggregation of all the values obtained in that hour.\nThe values column is empty since the offset and

It stands for Polygon changes in Space and Time and its main goal is \"to provide array and tabular vector data cube structures to organise and analyse polygons that change their shape in space and time\".\n\n::: column-margin\n\n![A new package is born! 📦](https://loreabad6.github.io/post/reference/figures/hexlogo.png)\n:::\n\nThe package is still work in progress but it already has a website and some basic documentation on its main functionalities. \nThe next step for me is to work on raster to vector data cube aggregations considering the dynamic nature of the data. \nYou can follow documentation of [that particular issue here](https://github.com/loreabad6/post/issues/1).\n\nI will be writing more posts on how I use `{post}` in my work and of the new features I am planning to implement.\nI hope this gives you a bit of curiosity and if you want, test the package already and let me know what you think!\n\nThanks for reading this post and attending the talk if you did! Until next time!\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Session info</summary>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsessioninfo::session_info()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt)\n os       Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)\n system   x86_64, mingw32\n ui       RTerm\n language ENG\n collate  English_Austria.utf8\n ctype    English_Austria.utf8\n tz       Europe/Vienna\n date     2024-10-15\n pandoc   3.1.11 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/resources/app/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version    date (UTC) lib source\n abind       * 1.4-5      2016-07-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n anytime       0.3.9      2020-08-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n class         7.3-22     2023-05-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n classInt      0.4-10     2023-09-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n cli           3.6.3      2024-06-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n colorspace    2.1-1      2024-07-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n cubble      * 1.0.0      2024-09-16 [1] local\n DBI           1.2.3      2024-06-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n digest        0.6.35     2024-03-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n dplyr       * 1.1.4      2023-11-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n e1071         1.7-14     2023-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n ellipsis      0.3.2      2021-04-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n evaluate      0.23       2023-11-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n fansi         1.0.6      2023-12-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n farver        2.1.2      2024-05-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n fastmap       1.1.1      2023-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n forcats     * 1.0.0      2023-01-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n generics      0.1.3      2022-07-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n ggplot2     * 3.5.1      2024-04-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n glue        * 1.7.0      2024-01-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n gtable        0.3.5      2024-04-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n here        * 1.0.1      2020-12-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n hms           1.1.3      2023-03-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n htmltools     0.5.8.1    2024-04-04 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n htmlwidgets   1.6.4      2023-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n jsonlite      1.8.8      2023-12-04 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n KernSmooth    2.23-22    2023-07-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n knitr         1.46       2024-04-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n labeling      0.4.3      2023-08-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n lifecycle     1.0.4      2023-11-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n lubridate   * 1.9.3      2023-09-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n magrittr      2.0.3      2022-03-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.3)\n munsell       0.5.1      2024-04-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n ncdf4         1.23       2024-08-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n pillar        1.9.0      2023-03-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n pkgconfig     2.0.3      2019-09-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n post        * 0.0.0.9000 2024-10-09 [1] local\n proxy         0.4-27     2022-06-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n purrr       * 1.0.2      2023-08-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n R6            2.5.1      2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n Rcpp          1.0.13     2024-07-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n readr       * 2.1.5      2024-01-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n rlang         1.1.4      2024-06-04 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n rmarkdown     2.28       2024-08-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n rprojroot     2.0.4      2023-11-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n rstudioapi    0.16.0     2024-03-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n s2            1.1.7      2024-07-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n scales        1.3.0      2023-11-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n sessioninfo   1.2.2      2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n sf          * 1.0-18     2024-10-09 [1] Github (r-spatial/sf@6f247a5)\n stars       * 0.6-7      2024-09-05 [1] Github (r-spatial/stars@ec1f849)\n stringi       1.8.4      2024-05-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n stringr     * 1.5.1      2023-11-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n tibble      * 3.2.1      2023-03-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n tidyr       * 1.3.1      2024-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n tidyselect    1.2.1      2024-03-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n tidyverse   * 2.0.0      2023-02-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n timechange    0.3.0      2024-01-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n tsibble       1.1.5      2024-06-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n tzdb          0.4.0      2023-05-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n units       * 0.8-5      2023-11-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n utf8          1.2.4      2023-10-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n vctrs         0.6.5      2023-12-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n viridisLite   0.4.2      2023-05-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n withr         3.0.1      2024-07-31 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n wk            0.9.3      2024-09-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n xfun          0.43       2024-03-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n yaml          2.3.8      2023-12-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n\n [1] C:/Users/b1066081/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.4\n [2] C:/Program Files/R/R-4.4.1/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n",
