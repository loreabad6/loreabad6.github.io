Result: error during rendering. \n\n`posterdown` uses Chrome or Chromium for rendering, and using fonts that are not available on the web can be a hassle.\n\nIf you still want to use your very cool font, a good option is to look for it at [similarfont.io](https://similarfont.io/), which can give you some ideas of alternative Google Fonts.\n\n## Tip #2\n\n> Want to adapt the `<style>`, go thorugh the HTML templates.\n\nOnce I was on the final steps of my poster development, I wanted to change this little details like padding around titles, font sizes, and so on. \n\nSome of these could be set on the file YAML, but others not. Also if you change from the `posterdown::posterdown_betterport` to `posterdown::posterdown_betterland`, some variables might not be named the same accross those. \n\nWhat saved me some time was going through the HTML templates on the `posterdown` repo. For example, find the one for the [better landscape template here](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/posterdown_betterland/resources/template.html).\n\nGoing through the template will reveal to you if what you want to change is a YAML parameter, most likely when the line starts with `$if(parameter_name)`.\n\nIf it is not a YAML parameter, you can add an HTML chunk to your RMarkdown file that will hopefully override the settings you want (it does not always work or I lack the HTML/CSS knowledge to figure out why!)\n\nThis are the HTML changes I made to my poster:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.html .cell-code}\n<style>\n.outer h1 {\n text-align: center;\n margin-top: 0.6in;\n margin-bottom: -0.4in;\n}\ncaption {\n margin-top: 0px;\n margin-bottom: 2px;\n padding-top: 0in;\n padding-bottom: 0in;\n font-size: 23pt;\n}\n.caption {\n margin-top: -2px;\n margin-bottom: 2px;\n padding-top: 0in;\n padding-bottom: 0in;\n font-size: 23pt;\n}\n.main p {\n padding-top: 0%;\n text-align: center;\n}\n.main_pic {\n margin-top: -1in;\n display: inline-block;\n text-align: center;\n}\n</style>\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Tip #3\n\n> Using `tmap` to show results? Take some shortcuts when designing\n\n`tmap` by Martijn Tennekes ([@MartijnTennekes](https://twitter.com/MartijnTennekes)) is an excellent package to generate beautiful maps, especially if you want to combine raster and vector data.\n\nBut, designing your figure might be hard when you want to add legends, or distinct elements and you suddenly have white space all around.\n\nThis can become specially frustrating when the space in your poster is not infinite. Version 4 for `tmap` is soon coming, but in the meantime I still use the CRAN version to build my plots. I find `tmap::tm_add_legend()` and `tmap::tmap_arrange()` excellent functions to work around design issues, and one shortcut I usually take is to build my legend separate from the map, so that I can work with the space in an easier way. \n\nBut, problem incoming! When I tried to print two different figures in RMarkdown, i.e. the actual plot and the legend in a single code chunk, the figure width and height was used for both figures, without options to provide different heights. \n\n**Result?** I had a very big white space below my legend. \n\n**Solution?** Use two code chunks! This will allow you to give different dimensions to each output. \nIf you need to add a figure caption, do it on the second plot, and to avoid an empty line between two figures, place your code chunks completely together, with no line break:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.markdown .cell-code}\n```{r}\n#| label: figure\n#| fig-width: 10\n#| fig-height: 10\n#| crop: true\nlibrary(tmap)\ntm1 = tm_shape(data) +\n  tm_polygons() \ntm2 = tm_shape(data) +\n  tm_polygons() \ntmap_arrange(tm1, tm2)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| label: legend\n#| fig-width: 10\n#| fig-height: 1\n#| fig-cap: \"Your figure caption.\"\n#| crop: true\ntm_shape(data) +\n  tm_polygons(legend.show = FALSE) +\n  tm_add_legend()\n```\n\n```\n:::\n# The final product!\n\nAnd here it is, the final poster at EGU! This is my first poster and I am happy to have found some interesting tools to come up with a nice result using R!\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/EGU23_AbadL_Poster-v2_compressed-1.png){width=4681}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
