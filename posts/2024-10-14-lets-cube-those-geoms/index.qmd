# BEGIN seminar

If you are here, it is very likely you attended the [BEGIN seminar from the University of St. Andrews](https://begin.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/activities-events/) today. Thank you for stopping by! üíê

I was invited by Dr. Fernando Benitez (thank you so much for considering me!) to give a talk on a topic I am working on, so I decided to [talk about vector data cubes](https://begin.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2024/09/26/begin-seminar-dr-lorena-cristina-abad-crespo/) üòä.
This post compliments the talk by writing out what I discussed during the seminar and by providing the code to reproduce some of the work I showed. 

Here are the slides of my talk today:

# Data cubes

Data cubes are ideal data structures for multidimensional data. Think of data with spatiotemporal properties such as satellite image time series (SITS). If you work with SITS you might already be familiar with data cubes, as Earth system data cubes have received quite some attention lately [@Mahecha2020].

:::

Tools and initiatives like [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), [OpenEO](https://openeo.org/) and [Digital Earth Africa](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/) are using data cubes as their core for SITS analysis.

Organizing SITS in data cubes is intuitive and logical given that satellite images have consistent X/Y coordinates per pixel, and any reacquisition over time keeps the same X/Y coordinates. Here we already identify three dimensions: `X`, `Y` and `time`. Satellite images also have bands and we can then consider those as a fourth dimension.

I wrote a post almost a year ago on how to create [on-demand data cubes with STAC with R and Python](https://loreabad6.github.io/posts/2023-10-17-stac-across-languages/).

# Vector data cubes

To quote @Pebesma_2023 at the very start of the Data Cubes Chapter:

> ‚ÄúData cubes arise naturally when we observe properties of a set of geometries repeatedly over time‚Äù.

Clearly satellite images for this description, being X and Y said ‚Äúgeometry‚Äù. But how other type of data like meteorological station data? They are also located in a X and Y location on Earth, represented by a `POINT` geometry. Stations collect data at constant time intervals, giving them a temporal dimension. Further, they can collect data on different type of phenomena, such as temperature, humidity, etc. So in essence, station data is multidimensional data that can be represented as a data cube. In this case, a *vector data cube* (VDCs).

![Vector data cube \| Source: @Pebesma_2023](figs/fig-aqdc-1.png)

::: column-margin
If you are familiar with databases, you will find that the concept of a vector data cube aligns greatly with an [OLAP cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP_cube) model.
:::

Another ‚Äúnaturally occurring‚Äù VDC case is when data from a raster or Earth system data cube is aggregated onto vector geometries. This vector geometries can be for example, political boundaries. The [`{stars}`](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/index.html) package has a great example of aggregation of precipitation data over the North Carolina counties [right here](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/index.html#raster-and-vector-time-series-analysis-example). This is a sneak peek:

# Load precipitation data

    read_stars()
# Load North Carolina data

```

# Exploring VDCs with R

If you do a search for ‚Äúvector data cubes R‚Äù, it is very likely that your first result is the `{stars}` package. As its name says, `{stars}` supports ‚Äúspatiotemporal **arrays**, rasters, and vector data cubes‚Äù.

::: column-margin
`{stars}` pioneered vector data cube implementations in current spatial data science languages. Further efforts in Python with the package [`{xvec}`](https://xvec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are inspired by initial development in `{stars}`.
:::

`{stars}` takes advantage of base R‚Äôs support for matrices and arrays to implement common data cube operations such as slicing (filtering), reducing (aggregating), and applying functions to dimensions.

Typically, data cubes are represented as multidimensional arrays given their capacity to support exactly that, multiple dimensions.
However, when only looking at spatio-temporal data, I also use the [`{cubble}`](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/) package that implements "a vector spatiotemporal data structure for data analysis" [@Zhang_2022].

`{stars}` and `{cubble}` interact very well when the data cube consists of space and time dimensions. 

To showcase this interaction I will make use of some data from the [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) project and build what I call array and tabular data cubes.

::: column-margin
[openSenseMap.org](https://opensensemap.org/) has the vision to become *"the Wikipedia for environmental data in order to awaken and promote education, environmental and climate protection, enthusiasm for STEM, citizen science, open data and open source."*

You can [donate to their cause here](https://opensensemap.org/donate).
:::

## Fetching the data

The openSenseMap project provides an API to query the information from the sensors shared on their website. 

I queried the API to obtain some data from sensors close to the city where I am based, Salzburg.
You can unfold the code below to see how I queried the API and pre-processed the data so that you know how to do this for other areas.
However, I saved the result of the querying and pre-processing to avoid exhausting the API.
The data is copyrighted as ¬© senseBox 2014 - 2020.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true

## parameters
bboxsbg = glue_collapse(c(12,47.5,13.5,47.9), sep = ",")
from = "2024-10-01T00:00:00Z"
to = "2024-10-03T00:00:00Z"
op = "arithmeticMean"
win = "1h"
format = "tidy"
cols = glue_collapse(c("boxId","boxName","lat","lon","phenomenon","unit"), sep = ",")
## api query
query = function(phenomenon) {
  glue("https://api.opensensemap.org/statistics/descriptive?bbox={bboxsbg}&from-date={from}&to-date={to}&phenomenon={phenomenon}&operation={op}&columns={cols}&window={win}&format={format}")
}
## fetch data
temperature = read_csv(query("Temperatur"))
pm10 = read_csv(query("PM10"))
pm25 = read_csv(query("PM2.5"))
## check if data is complete, if not, complete cases
dim(temperature)
dim(pm10)
dim(pm25)
temperature_comp = temperature |> 
  complete(
    nesting(boxName, lon, lat), time_start,
    nesting(phenomenon, unit)
)
# merge data into one file and complete cases for all stations
opensense = bind_rows(temperature_comp, pm10, pm25) |> 
  select(-sensorId, -boxId) |> 
  complete(
    nesting(boxName, lon, lat, time_start),
    nesting(phenomenon, unit)
  ) |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat")) |> 
  st_set_crs(4326)
write_sf("data/opensensemap.gpkg")
```

To read in the saved data, we can use the `{sf}` package.

```{r}
(opensense = read_sf("data/opensensemap.gpkg"))
# (opensense = read_sf("posts/2024-10-14-lets-cube-those-geoms/data/opensensemap.gpkg"))
```

As you can notice, the data has several data duplicates, since it is presented in a long format. 
In this way each row contains the station name (`boxName`), the timestamp (`time_start`) and the parameter measured (`phenomenon`). 
Each station also has a `POINT` geometry and each measurement has its corresponding unit. 

The measured values (`arithmeticMean_1h`) are the only changing variables. 
This value, as can be seen on the query code, is the arithmetic mean per hour of the observations for temperature, PM2.5 and PM10 for the sensors in the bounding box given.
Not every sensor measures all the values and therefore there are `NA`s within the data. 

```{r}
sum(is.na(opensense$arithmeticMean_1h))
```

That is a lot of empty data!
The reason to introduce so many NAs is that to create an array, we need that every dimension has an equal number of entries.

## Creating a VDC with `{stars}`

Although creating a raster data cube from SITS data is pretty straightforward in `{stars}`, creating a VDC requires a bit more pre-processing.

However, when creating a VDC from scratch we get to understand better how [`stars` objects are structured](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/articles/stars4.html).

> "`{stars}` provides infrastructure for *data cubes*, array data with labeled dimensions".

So, we start with the *dimensions*.

> "A `dimensions` object is a named list of dimension elements, each describing the semantics a dimension of the data arrays (space, time, type etc)."

First, we identify the dimensions in the `opensense` object.
We have a geometry (`geom`) that identifies and locates each station in space and we have a timestamp (`time_start`) that marks the temporal dimension.
The `point` parameter indicates if the dimension has point support (`point = TRUE` in the case of our `geom`) or if it is a period (`point = FALSE` in the case of our `time_start`).

```{r}
(d = st_dimensions(
  geom = st_sfc(unique(opensense$geom), crs = st_crs(opensense)),
  time = unique(opensense$time_start),
  point = c(TRUE, FALSE)
))
```

Take a moment to check the output of this `dimensions` object.
We have established the semantics of the data array dimensions. 
With this we guarantee that there are 7 stations and 50 timestamps. 
The `geom` dimension, that contains the geometries of the 7 stations have a CRS (WGS84), have point support and we can see a glimpse of the `POINT` geometries under the values column.

The `time` dimension on the other hand starts with index 1 and finishes at index 50.
The offset indicated the first time index, while the delta contains the information on the frequency of the temporal data, in this case, 1 hour.
We set this as a period, since it is an aggregation of all the values obtained in that hour.
The values column is empty since the offset and delta can save all the needed information. 
Don't worry your data is still there!

```{r}
st_get_dimension_values(d, "geom")
st_get_dimension_values(d, "time")
```

Now, let's focus on the *array data*. 

> "`stars` objects consist of a (possibly empty) named list of arrays, each having named dimensions (`dim`) attribute".

To create an array in R we need to establish the maximal indices in each dimension. 
As we did above when building the `dimensions` object, we create now a vector with the dimensions in which we will arrange the array data. 

```{r}
dims = c(
  length(unique(opensense$boxName)),
  length(unique(opensense$time_start))
)
```

The order in which the data is assigned to each element in an array is important. 
Normally, arrays are assigned in a per column basis. 
For this, we order our data first by the last set dimension (time) and then by the first one (station geom).

```{r}
opensense = opensense[order(opensense[["time_start"]],opensense[["boxName"]]), ]
```

And now we create the arrays to pass onto the `stars` object during creation. 
We create one array per parameter.
For that we filter the data to the corresponding `phenomenon`.
Then we extract the measured values and pass them onto the `array()` function, assigning the `dims` object created above. 
Finally, we pass the units to the array for each parameter.

::: column-margin
Instead of creating the three arrays, we can also create a third dimension for the parameters.
:::

```{r}
# Create temperature array
temp = filter(opensense, phenomenon == "Temperatur")
temp_arr = array(temp$arithmeticMean_1h, dim = dims)
units(temp_arr) = as_units(unique(temp$unit))
# Create PM2.5 array
pm25 = filter(opensense, phenomenon == "PM2.5")
pm25_arr = array(pm25$arithmeticMean_1h, dim = dims)
units(pm25_arr) = as_units(unique(pm25$unit))
# Create PM10 array
pm10 = filter(opensense, phenomenon == "PM10")
pm10_arr = array(pm10$arithmeticMean_1h, dim = dims)
units(pm10_arr) = as_units(unique(pm10$unit))
```

And with that, we can create our VDC using `{stars}`.

```{r}
(opensense_stars = st_as_stars(
  temperature = temp_arr,
  `PM2.5` = pm25_arr,
  PM10 = pm10_arr,
  d
))
```

Note how the units for each parameter are also recognized, and how we can get a quick glimpse of the summary statistics for each one.

::: column-margin
One thing I always find challenging is passing the arrays in the correct order. When building your own cube, make sure to double check that the original data is assigned to the correct dimensions!
:::

## Cube operations

We can take a small peek at how the PM10 data looks like for example. 
For this we can do some **subsetting** of our data cube using `[`. 

The first element corresponds to the attributes, so here we call the PM10 attribute.
The second element is the `geom` dimension. We want to keep all the stations, so we keep it as it is. 
Finally, the last element is the time dimension. I took a subset from the first to the ninth hour (to avoid plotting 50 hours of data but also to show you how to subset üòâ).

::: column-margin
You find here a glimpse of the operations you can run in a data cube with `{stars}`. Take a look at the [package vignettes](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/articles/stars1.html#switching-attributes-to-dimensions-and-back) and the [Spatial Data Science book](https://r-spatial.org/book/06-Cubes.html#sec-dcoperations) for a more comprehensive overview.
:::

```{r}
#| column: page
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-cap: "PM10 hourly measurements for openSenseMap stations."
plot(opensense_stars["PM10",,1:9], pch = 16)
```

Another interesting operation is to convert attributes to dimensions (with `merge()`) and vice-versa (with `split()`).
This is helpful when specific subsetting over the dimension is desired, or if a function should be applied over set dimension. 

```{r}
opensense_stars |> 
  drop_units() |> 
  merge(name = "parameter")
```

Another strong operation in data cubes is the ability to aggregate dimensions to larger units, applying functions for this aggregation. 
Here for instance, we aggregate the data to a daily mean.

```{r}
(opensense_daily = opensense_stars |> 
  aggregate("1 day", mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
#| column: page
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 2.5
#| fig-cap: "Daily mean temperature for openSenseMap stations."
# for some reason the aggregation step is not recognized 
# by geom_stars so I converted the stars object to a long 
# sf and used geom_sf instead
ggplot(drop_units(st_as_sf(opensense_daily, long = TRUE))) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = temperature), size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(
    "Mean temperature [¬∞C]",
    na.value = "grey85", option = "inferno"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~time, ncol = 3) +
  theme_bw()
```

Several other operations can be performed using vector data cubes. Check the annotations on the margins for more content!

## Converting to `{cubble}`

We can directly convert our `stars` object into a `cubble`. 
We will use a couple of tricks to do so.

A `cubble` requires a `key` which is the spatial identifier, and an `index` which is the temporal identifier. 
The `index` is quite straightforward since we can pass the time dimension directly.
Passing a geometry as a `key`, however, is not well supported yet, and therefore we use the trick of calling an "id" dimension.
This works because during coercion from a `stars` object `{cubble}` creates an internal id column to identify each spatial element.
This might change, but for now it is the workaround we can take advantage of. 

```{r}
opensense_cubble = opensense_stars |> 
  as_cubble(key = id, index = time)
```

::: column-margin

Learn more about [cubble data structure here](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/index.html#how-cubble-organises-spatio-temporal-data).

![Spatiotemporal data structure in `{cubble}`](https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/reference/figures/cubble-operations.png)
:::

`{cubble}` organizes spatiotemporal data in two faces, a nested cubble represents the temporal face, and a long cubble holds the time series.
One can pivot back and forth from either face using the `face_spatial()` and `face_temporal()` functions.

```{r}
opensense_cubble |> face_spatial()
opensense_cubble |> face_temporal()
```

One strong point for `{cubble}` when dealing with spatiotemporal data is that there is no need any more to have an even number of observations as with an array.

If we create a `cubble` from our original opensense data, this becomes clearer:

```{r}
opensense |> 
  drop_na(arithmeticMean_1h) |> 
  select(-unit) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = phenomenon, values_from = arithmeticMean_1h) |> 
  as_cubble(key = boxName, index = time_start)
```

Note the information under the `ts` column. You can now see there that the number of observations logged for each station is unequal.

`cubble` has many interesting functions, but one of the highlights for me is the ability to create glyph maps. 
A glyph map allows you to understand the temporal dynamics of your data, while also considering their location in space.

# VDCs for dynamic spatial data

The reason why I got so interested in VDCs was because I work often with SITS. 
A lot of the work we do at my research groups ([Risk, Hazard & Climate](https://www.plus.ac.at/geoinformatik/research/research-areas/risk-hazard-climate/?lang=en) and [EO-Analytics](https://www.plus.ac.at/geoinformatik/research/research-areas/eo-analytics/?lang=en)) is to map natural hazards to monitor their evolution using Earth observation (EO) data cubes.
This mapping often results in vector delineations derived from EO data.
They are spatio-temporal in essence but once the delineation was finished, the nice properties of data cubes.

Then I realized that vector data cubes could be a potential way to organize these "dynamic spatial data".
VDCs are meant to work with vector geometries but the big challenge here was that unlike weather stations, my geometries where evolving over time.
Moreover, the way the geometries evolve is important and it is necessary to keep that complex polygon structure within the analysis. 

That is how I ended up coming with the concept of summary geometries and with the decision to add the changing geometries as elements of the array.

Although relatively straightforward, setting up vector data cubes both in `{stars}` and `{cubble}` that support dynamic spatial data required the creation of new classes and methods that could easily support this *special* data structure.

That is how [`{post}`](https://loreabad6.github.io/post/) started. It stands for Polygon changes in Space and Time and its main goal is "to provide array and tabular vector data cube structures to organise and analyse polygons that change their shape in space and time".

:::

The package is still work in progress but it already has a website and some basic documentation on its main functionalities. 
The next step for me is to work on raster to vector data cube aggregations considering the dynamic nature of the data. 
You can follow documentation of [that particular issue here](https://github.com/loreabad6/post/issues/1).

I will be writing more posts on how I use `{post}` in my work and of the new features I am planning to implement.
I hope this gives you a bit of curiosity and if you want, test the package already and let me know what you think!
