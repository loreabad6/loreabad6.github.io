  Title = {Geo citizen science and the role of participatory design in the field of geomorphology},
  Volume = {26},
  Year = {2020},
  Abstract = {Citizen science, aiming at integrating citizens, their commitment and knowledge into scientific research, is a powerful way to create additional research outputs and scientific knowledge. This is particularly true when geospatial technology is used to enable citizens to contribute spatial data. While fields such as biology and ecology make abundant use of geo citizen science, only a limited number of projects approach topics related to geomorphology. Due to climate change and its impact on the Earth's surface, research activities that use citizen science are considered very useful to support the work of geomorphologists. However, geomorphology is a complex topic to engage with citizens. Thus, to reach and involve citizens in geomorphological research, we need spatial data collection tools that are tailored to their needs and raise their interest in geomorphology. For this, participatory design is a valuable option since it allows us to get comprehensive information about citizens and their requirements and to integrate this information into the development process. Now, does participatory design reveal requirements otherwise unknown to the developers? What additional efforts must be made when cooperating with citizens in participatory design? The citizenMorph project, which addresses these questions, found that detailed and valuable insights can be gained (regarding, e.g., information delivery, design issues, and community building), but also that additional efforts are required in terms of the composition of the project team, the interaction and communication during the development process, and the selection of methods, tools and material to be used.},

  Title = {Distinct types of landslides in moraines associated with the post-LIA glacier thinning: Observations from the Kinzl Glacier, Huascar{\'{a}}n, Peru},
  Volume = {739},
  Year = {2020},
  Abstract = {The Kinzl Glacier is a unique dendritic-type glacier of the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca and is surrounded by well-developed Little Ice Age (LIA) moraines. Based on field observations and analysis of historical photographs (since 1932) and remotely sensed images (since 1948), we interpret distinct mechanisms of landslides in these moraines and link them to glacier retreat and thinning. Three types of landslides are distinguished according to the cross-profile morphology: (i) type “N”, (ii) type “M” and (iii) type “A”. Our data show that sliding of type “N” is an ice-contact slope failure that occurs as a gradual process simultaneously to glacier downwasting. In contrast, type “A” can occur at any time once the glacier has downwasted below the sliding plane and cannot buttress the nearly vertical inner slopes of the moraine anymore. We further argue that the type “M” can gradually evolve from type “N” or can occur as an episodic event. Probably due to overconsolidation of moraine material, landslides of types “N” and “M” keep their shape during sliding and move in form of several hundred meters long unbroken blocks. In contrast type “A” is internally disintegrated during landsilding. All investigated landslide types are characterized by increased width-length ratio and movement perpendicular to the direction of the flow of the glacier. We opine that the occurrence of these landslide types is directly or indirectly associated with glacial ice loss occurring since the end of the LIA. The observed landslides in the LIA moraines of the Kinzl Glacier are unique in the regional context considering their estimated size on the order of 106 m3 and contribute significantly to the paraglacial adjustment of moraine slopes and landform evolution in the post-LIA context. Apart from their role in moraine evolution, these landslides can trigger hazardous cascading process-chains in high-alpine environments.},

  Title = {Assessment of Landslide-Induced Geomorphological Changes in H{\'{i}}tardalur Valley, Iceland, Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data},
  Volume = {10},
  Year = {2020},
  Abstract = {Landslide mapping and analysis are essential aspects of hazard and risk analysis. Landslides can block rivers and create landslide-dammed lakes, which pose a significant risk for downstream areas. In this research, we used an object-based image analysis approach to map geomorphological features and related changes and assess the applicability of Sentinel-1 data for the fast creation of post-event digital elevation models (DEMs) for landslide volume estimation. We investigated the H{\'{i}}tardalur landslide, which occurred on the 7 July 2018 in western Iceland, along with the geomorphological changes induced by this landslide, using optical and synthetic aperture radar data from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1. The results show that there were no considerable changes in the landslide area between 2018 and 2019. However, the landslide-dammed lake area shrunk between 2018 and 2019. Moreover, the H{\'{i}}tar{\'{a}} river diverted its course as a result of the landslide. The DEMs, generated by ascending and descending flight directions and three orbits, and the subsequent volume estimation revealed that—without further post-processing—the results need to be interpreted with care since several factors influence the DEM generation from Sentinel-1 imagery.},

  Abstract = {textcopyright} Copyright S. Franz et al. To exploit the potential of geo citizen science, technological solutions are needed that are tailored to the requirements of citizens and scientists. To create suitable solutions, participatory design is a valuable means. While information on techniques for requirement-gathering in cooperation with future solution users exists, less knowledge is available regarding tools for creating solutions together with future solution users. One tool used in a professional setting is ESRI's Survey123 for ArcGIS. The suitability of Survey123 for ArcGIS to implement geo citizen science solutions was evaluated within the citizenMorph project. The experiences showed that by using Survey123 for ArcGIS most requirements were met, but citizens faced a number of challenges using the citizenMorph solution developed.},

  Title = {Mapping and Analyzing the Evolution of the Butangbunasi Landslide Using Landsat Time Series with Respect to Heavy Rainfall Events during Typhoons},
  Volume = {10},
  Year = {2020},
  Abstract = {Large rainfall-induced landslides are among the most dangerous natural hazards in Taiwan, posing a risk for people and infrastructure. Thus, better knowledge about the evolution of landslides and their impact on the downstream area is of high importance for disaster mitigation. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) to semi-automatically map the evolution of the Butangbunasi landslide in south-central Taiwan using satellite remote sensing data, and (2) to investigate the potential correlation between changes in landslide area and heavy rainfall during typhoon events. Landslide area, as well as temporary landslide-dammed lakes, were semi-automatically identified using object-based image analysis (OBIA), based on 20 Landsat images from 1984 to 2018. Hourly rainfall data from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) was complemented with rainfall data from Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) to examine the potential relationship between landslide area changes and rainfall as a triggering factor. The OBIA mapping results revealed that the most significant landslide extension happened after typhoon Morakot in 2009. We found a moderate positive relationship between the landslide area change and the duration of the heavy rainfall event, whereas daily precipitation, cumulative rainfall and mean intensity did not present strong significant correlations.},

  Title = {An Object-Based Approach for Monitoring the Evolution of Landslide-dammed lakes and Detecting Triggering Landslides in Taiwan},
  Volume = {XLII-3/W8},
  Year = {2019},
  Abstract = {Abstract. In August 2009, Typhoon Morakot caused a record-breaking rainfall in Taiwan. The heavy rainfall triggered thousands of landslides, in particular in the central-southern part of the island. Large landslides can block rivers and can lead to the formation of landslide-dammed lakes. Cascading hazards like floods and debris flows after landslide dam breaches pose a high risk for people and infrastructure downstream. Thus, better knowledge about landslides that significantly impact the channel system and about the resulting landslide-dammed lakes are key elements for assessing the direct and indirect hazards caused by the moving mass. The main objectives of this study are 1) to develop an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach for semi-automated detection of landslides that caused the formation of landslide-dammed lakes and 2) to monitor the evolution of landslide-dammed lakes based on Landsat imagery. For landslide and lake mapping, primarily spectral indices and contextual information were used. By integrating morphological and hydrological parameters derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) into the OBIA framework, we automatically identified landslide-dammed lakes, and the landslides that likely caused the formation of those lakes, due to the input of large amounts of debris into the channel system. The proposed approach can be adapted to other remote sensing platforms and can be used to monitor the evolution of landslide-dammed lakes and triggering landslides at regional scale after typhoon and heavy rainstorm events within an efficient time range after suitable remote sensing data has been provided.},

  Title = {Assessment of Landslide-Induced Morphology Changes using an Object-Based Image Analysis Approach: a Case Study of H{\'{i}}tardalur, Iceland},
  Volume = {XLII-3/W8},
  Year = {2019},
  Abstract = {Abstract. On July 7, 2018, a large landslide occurred at the eastern slope of the Fagrask{\'{o}}garfjall Mountain in H{\'{i}}tardalur valley in West Iceland. The landslide dammed the river, led to the formation of a lake and, consequently, to a change in the river course. The main focus of this research is to develop a knowledge-based expert system using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach for identifying morphology changes caused by the H{\'{i}}tardalur landslide. We use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data, in particular from Sentinel-1/2 for detection of the landslide and its effects on the river system. We extracted and classified the landslide area, the landslide-dammed lake, other lakes and the river course using intensity information from S1 and spectral information from S2 in the object-based framework. Future research will focus on further developing this approach to support mapping and monitoring of the spatio-temporal dynamics of surface morphology in an object-based framework by combining SAR and optical data. The results can reveal details on the applicability of different remote sensing data for the spatio-temporal investigation of landslides, landslide-induced river course changes and lake formation and lead to a better understanding of the impact of large landslides on river systems.},
